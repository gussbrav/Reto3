comportamiento colectivo de las hormigas al buscar la ruta más eficiente hacia una fuente de alimento. Utiliza feromonas artificiales para guiar la exploración del espacio de soluciones, reforzando caminos más prometedores a medida que más soluciones pasan por ellos. A través de la evaporación de feromonas y la exploración estocástica, el algoritmo equilibra la explotación de rutas eficientes con la búsqueda de nuevas alternativas, lo que lo hace ideal para problemas de optimización combinatoria, como el problema del viajero o el enrutamiento de redes."],"metadata":{"id":"slXNxMmncN71"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import random\n","\n","def seleccionar_nodo(problem, historial, feromonas):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Selecciona un nodo para añadir a la solución basándose en los nodos disponibles.\n","\n","    Parámetros:\n","    - problem: instancia del problema que contiene los nodos.\n","    - historial: lista de nodos ya visitados.\n","    - feromonas: matriz de feromonas que podrían influir en la selección (a mejorar en el futuro).\n","\n","    Retorna:\n","    - Un nodo aleatorio que no haya sido visitado.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    nodos_disponibles = list(problem.get_nodes())\n","    return random.choice(list(set(range(1, len(nodos_disponibles))) - set(historial)))\n","\n","def reforzar_feromonas(problem, feromonas, trayectoria):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Incrementa las feromonas en función de la calidad de la solución encontrada.\n","\n","    Parámetros:\n","    - problem: instancia del problema.\n","    - feromonas: matriz de feromonas a actualizar.\n","    - trayectoria: lista de nodos recorridos en la solución.\n","\n","    Retorna:\n","    - La matriz de feromonas actualizada.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    refuerzo = 1000 / distancia_total(trayectoria, problem)\n","    for i in range(len(trayectoria) - 1):\n","        feromonas[trayectoria[i]][trayectoria[i + 1]] += refuerzo\n","    return feromonas\n","\n","def feromonas(feromonas):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Reduce la cantidad de feromonas en la matriz para evitar acumulaciones excesivas.\n","\n","    Parámetros:\n","    - feromonas: matriz de feromonas.\n","\n","    Retorna:\n","    - La matriz de feromonas después de aplicar la evaporación.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    nodos = len(feromonas)\n","    return [[max(feromonas[i][j] - 0.3, 1) for i in range(nodos)] for j in range(nodos)]\n"],"metadata":{"id":"9PLeJFqXcPMK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740781435628,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":37,"user":{"displayName":"Gustavo Bravo","userId":"00021252019395973956"}}},"execution_count":54,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def hormigas(problem, N) :\n","  #problem = datos del problema\n","  #N = Número de agentes(hormigas)\n","\n","  #Nodos\n","  Nodos = list(problem.get_nodes())\n","  #Aristas\n","  Aristas = list(problem.get_edges())\n","\n","  #Inicializa las aristas con una cantidad inicial de feromonas:1\n","  #Mejora: inicializar con valores diferentes dependiendo diferentes criterios\n","  T = [[ 1 for _ in range(len(Nodos)) ] for _ in range(len(Nodos))]\n","\n","  #Se generan los agentes(hormigas) que serán estructuras de caminos desde 0\n","  Hormiga = [[0] for _ in range(N)]\n","\n","  #Recorre cada agente construyendo la solución\n","  for h in range(N) :\n","    #Para cada agente se construye un camino\n","    for i in range(len(Nodos)-1) :\n","\n","      #Elige el siguiente nodo\n","      Nuevo_Nodo = seleccionar_nodo(problem, Hormiga[h] ,T )\n","      Hormiga[h].append(Nuevo_Nodo)\n","\n","    #Incrementa feromonas en esa arista\n","    T = reforzar_feromonas(problem, T, Hormiga[h] )\n","    #print(\"Feromonas(1)\", T)\n","\n","    #Evapora Feromonas\n","    T = feromonas(T)\n","    #print(\"Feromonas(2)\", T)\n","\n","    #Seleccionamos el mejor agente\n","  mejor_solucion = []\n","  mejor_distancia = 10e100\n","  for h in range(N) :\n","    distancia_actual = distancia_total(Hormiga[h], problem)\n","    if distancia_actual < mejor_distancia:\n","      mejor_solucion = Hormiga[h]\n","      mejor_distancia =distancia_actual\n","\n","\n","  print(mejor_solucion)\n","  print(mejor_distancia)\n","\n","\n","hormigas(problem, 1000)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"_kv02KJ2cSdE","outputId":"de3a1878-b63f-4c9f-eb35-d26f12e7357a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740781440081,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1100,"user":{"displayName":"Gustavo Bravo","userId":"00021252019395973956"}}},"execution_count":55,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[0, 16, 4, 17, 35, 22, 34, 9, 23, 19, 13, 11, 21, 24, 26, 3, 38, 5, 25, 10, 1, 30, 36, 39, 37, 14, 15, 20, 33, 29, 40, 2, 27, 28, 12, 8, 41, 6, 32, 31, 7, 18]\n","3995\n"]}]}]}
